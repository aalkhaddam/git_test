    <h2>Lesson: Links</h2>
    <p>Links: use the a element - called Anchor </p> 
    <p><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank">About Odin Project</a></p>
    <p>To add a link/destination, we use an attribute within the element by doing: href="link"</p>
    <p>To change where the link is opened, use the target element</p>
    <p>The rel attribute describes the relation between the current page and the link</p>
    <ul>
        <li>noopener value: prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened</li>
        <li>noreferrer value: prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link or reference to it
            <ul>
                <li>has noopener behaviour so can be by itself</li>
                <li>both of these present security for phishing attacks (noopener) 
                    because it stops the new webpage from changing the old webpage to a new one (tabnabbing)</li>
                <li>new browsers have security measures for this, but it's still good to pair target blank with 
                    those 2 rel values</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Absolute links are links to pages on websites on the internet</p>
    <ul>
        <li>have the following parts: protocol://domain/path</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Relative links are links to pages within our own website</p>
    <ul>
        <li>do not contain domain name since it assumes the domain will be the same</li>
        <li>only include file path</li>
        <li>This is a relative link: <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a></li>
        <li>if linking something within your directory, add ./ before it to not run into issues 
            (e.g., ./pages/about or ./index) </li>
        <li>to go up a directory, double .. - e.g., ../folder_in_parent_directory/etc</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson: Images</h2>
    <!-- First self closing element we're using - just puttin in some comments-->
    <p> use img element, a self closing element with no / ending tag. Also, the location can be made with the src="" attribute</p>
    <p> remember to add the "alt" attribute for screen readers and when the image isn't visible</p>
